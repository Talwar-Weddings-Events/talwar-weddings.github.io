                <strong>Event Coordination and Management:</strong> For couples that have done most of the planning themselves, but want to enjoy their wedding and sleep better the month leading up to it. I will help ensure you have covered all the details, confirm logistics with vendors, and run the show on your big day from set-up to clean-up. This package is best to book at least 1-3 months before your wedding. ($1,000+ depending on size/complexity)

                Hello! I'm Ali Talwar and I'm so happy you found Talwar Weddings & Events! I decided to pursue event planning full time after planning my own wedding and all the events surrounding it. I absolutely thrived getting to make spreadsheets, timelines, and creating other &ldquo;type-A&rdquo; forms of organization. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Before pivoting into event planning, I had a career in International Development where I worked in the Project Management Office at a non-profit. Thankfully, I have found many of those skills apply in this new space and now consider myself the &ldquo;project manager&rdquo; of your events!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been lucky to gain experience in the industry by assisting seasoned wedding planners in the area and by planning my friends&rsquo; weddings and birthdays. I have found such a passion in this career and find complete joy in working with all kinds of people to create their unique events! 
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Favorite hobbies:</em> Binging a great TV show with my husband; Going on walks with friends in Rock Creek Park; Reading fantasy books; Biking, swimming, hiking, or even just sitting in the park on a nice day
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Fun fact about me:</em> I have lived in 13 different cities, largely because my parents were in the Navy. But I moved to Thailand for two years on my own while serving in the Peace Corps as an English Teacher!
